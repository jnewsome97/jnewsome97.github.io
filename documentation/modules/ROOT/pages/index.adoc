This workshop has been crafted to equip participants with essential skills and knowledge for **effectively operating Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4**â€”a hybrid cloud platform that supports containerized applications.

In the Ops Track you will learn about:

* **OpenShift** Administrator Fundamentals

* Multi-cluster management with **Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)**
